## 🧠 Algorithm & Deployment (Step-by-Step)

1. **Input Destination** → User enters a place in the search field.  
2. **API Call via n8n** → React sends request to n8n for destination & weather data.  
3. **Dynamic Rendering** → Data updates instantly in cards, gallery, and weather section.  
4. **Deployment** → Final app deployed via **Netlify**, with n8n backend hosted separately.
